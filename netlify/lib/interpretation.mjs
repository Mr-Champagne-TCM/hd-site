/**
 * TIER 2 -- the written interpretation.
 *
 * PORTED FROM THE APP, not reinvented. `hd-reading-app`'s `Reading.kt` has been
 * generating these for real clients; its prompt, its section list and its
 * validator are the product. Rewriting them here would give two different
 * readings depending on which door somebody came in through, which is the same
 * fault E-1 exists to prevent for the engine.
 *
 * THE PRIVACY RULE IS THE FIRST THING IN THIS FILE, because it is the one that
 * cannot be fixed after the fact:
 *
 *   GEMINI RECEIVES CHART VALUES ONLY. Never a name, never a birth date, never
 *   a birth time, never a place. Google offers no deletion path for API
 *   content, so the protection is that identifying data is never sent at all.
 *
 * `chartFactsOnly` is the ONLY thing that goes over the wire, and the test
 * beside this file feeds it a record full of identity and asserts none of it
 * survives. If you add a field, check it against that rule first.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE YET: the network call. This module is the CONTRACT -- what
 * is asked for, and what counts as an acceptable answer -- and it is written
 * first on purpose. A generator is worth nothing until something can say the
 * answer came back wrong.
